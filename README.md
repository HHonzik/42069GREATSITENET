Just a few files that need to be downloaded from the website (# [42069.great-site.net](https://42069.great-site.net)) for a weird batch program
i call it Customath (it is czech for no reason)
if you want to download it, you can use the Customath.zip, or go to [https://42069.great-site.net/Assets/Customath.htm](https://42069.great-site.net/Assets/Customath.htm)
(im too lazy to fix a problem that happens if the folder in which is the program is not Customath then it will just make a new folder into which the update will be saved)
